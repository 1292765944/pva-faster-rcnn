## PVANET: Deep but Lightweight Neural Networks for Real-time Object Detection
by Kye-Hyeon Kim, Yeongjae Cheon, Sanghoon Hong, Byungseok Roh, Minje Park

### Introduction
This repository is a fork from [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) and demonstrates the performance of PVANET.

You can refer to [py-faster-rcnn README.md](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/README.md) and [faster-rcnn README.md](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

### Desclaimer

Please note that this repository doesn't contain our in-house runtime code used in the published article.
- Current implementation is slower at test-time than the reported version because py-faster-rcnn uses an older version of CuDNN and some parts are written in Python.
- If testing parameters in py-faster-rcnn codes have been changed, there might be a tiny difference in VOC2012 test results as well.
- The training of the reported model wasn't done with this implementation.
